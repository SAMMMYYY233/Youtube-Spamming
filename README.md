# Youtube-Spamming

Function: Allows you to mass-delete delete all comment replies by a particular user all at once.
 Purpose:  Recently, there has been a massive infestation of spam on YouTube where fake impersonator
           accounts leave spam/scam replies to hundreds of users on a creator's videos.
           
           For some god-forsaken reason, YouTube offers no way to delete all comments by a specific
      user at once, meaning you must delete them one by one BY HAND.
          YouTube offers a functionality to ban a user, but it does NOT delete previous comments.
           Therefore I created this script to allow you to instantly purge their spam comments.

 NOTES:    1. The script also scans top level comments from the spammer
